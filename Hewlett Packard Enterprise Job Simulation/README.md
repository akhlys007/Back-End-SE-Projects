# Hewlett Packard Enterprise Software Engineering Job Simulation

## Overview

This repository contains the tasks that were completed as part of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Software Engineering Job Simulation. The simulation involved learning and applying various software engineering skills using Java Spring Boot, HPE GreenLake, and RESTful web services. Below is a detailed description of the tasks that were undertaken during the simulation.

## Task 1: Create a Proposal for a RESTful Web Service

### Task Overview
In this task, the goal was to understand the basics of Java Spring Boot, HPE GreenLake, and RESTful Web Services.

### What was learned
- The basics of Java Spring Boot
- Introduction to HPE GreenLake
- Fundamentals of RESTful Web Services

### What was done
- Met with the supervisor, Stella Yun, a senior software engineering director at Hewlett Packard Enterprise.
- Explored the technical documentation for Java Spring Boot and GreenLake Cloud Platform.
- Wrote a proposal for a RESTful web service to manage a list of employees.

## Task 2: Build a Basic RESTful Web Service

### Task Overview
This task focused on leveraging Java Spring Boot to build a web server application capable of handling HTTP requests.

### What was learned
- How to use Java Spring Boot to build a web server application.
- How to accept and respond to HTTP requests.

### What was done
- Built a basic web server application in Java Spring Boot that could accept and respond to HTTP requests.

## Task 3: Implement the Ability to Upload Data

### Task Overview
The objective of this task was to enable the application to handle data uploads using HTTP POST requests and to transfer JSON data to a hosted web application.

### What was learned
- Functionality of HTTP POST requests for adding data dynamically.
- How JSON data can be transferred to a hosted web application.

### What was done
- Enhanced the application to support uploading JSON data.

## Task 4: Create Unit Tests

### Background Information
This task involved ensuring the software was functioning correctly before deployment by writing and running automated unit tests using frameworks such as Mockito or JUnit.

### What was learned
- Importance of unit tests in software development.
- How to write automated tests for a Java Spring Boot application using Mockito or JUnit frameworks.

### What was done
- Developed and ran a set of unit tests to assess the applicationâ€™s performance.

## Conclusion

These tasks provided a comprehensive introduction to Java Spring Boot, HPE GreenLake, and RESTful web services, while also emphasizing the importance of testing in software development. Each task built upon the previous one, resulting in a fully functional and tested RESTful web service application.
